          Our mission is best described as
          <span class="italic">theological discipleship</span>-a form of
          discipleship that seeks to bring both thought and behaviour under the
          lordship of Christ in fellowship with the work of the Holy Spirit.
          Primarily this means gaining a deep understanding of God's great act
          toward us in Christ, and therefore, the consequences of the Gospel for
          all of human endeavour. It rests on a foundation of Biblical
          exposition and historical orthodoxy, and is expressed as a living
          theology in robust engagement with the real world.
        </div>
        <div class="lg:w-1/2 px-2">
          We believe a deep theological grounding can only be truly achieved
          within community. At KRUX, community is undergirded by study courses
          and dialogue, mentorship, practicing hospitality, and engaging with
          the Arts.
